Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

Hint: This is just to test your memory of the basic arithmetic commands, work backwards from 100.25

In [1]:
# Your answer is probably different
(60 + (10 ** 2) / 4 * 7) - 134.75
Out[1]:
100.25
Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.

What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)

What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 

What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5 
In [2]:
4 * (6 + 5)
Out[2]:
44
In [3]:
4 * 6 + 5
Out[3]:
29
In [4]:
4 + 6 * 5
Out[4]:
34
What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?

Answer: Floating Point Number

What would you use to find a numberâ€™s square root, as well as its square?

In [5]:
# Square root:
100 ** 0.5
Out[5]:
10.0
In [6]:
# Square:
10 ** 2
Out[6]:
100
Strings
Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:

In [7]:
s = 'hello'
# Print out 'e' using indexing

s[1]
Out[7]:
'e'
Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:

In [8]:
s ='hello'
# Reverse the string using slicing

s[::-1]
Out[8]:
'olleh'
Given the string 'hello', give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.

In [9]:
s ='hello'
# Print out the 'o'

# Method 1:

s[-1]
Out[9]:
'o'
In [10]:
# Method 2:

s[4]
Out[10]:
'o'
Lists
Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.

In [11]:
# Method 1:
[0]*3
Out[11]:
[0, 0, 0]
In [12]:
# Method 2:
list2 = [0,0,0]
list2
Out[12]:
[0, 0, 0]
Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:

In [13]:
list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]
In [14]:
list3[2][2] = 'goodbye'
In [15]:
list3
Out[15]:
[1, 2, [3, 4, 'goodbye']]
Sort the list below:

In [16]:
list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]
In [17]:
# Method 1:
sorted(list4)
Out[17]:
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
In [18]:
# Method 2:
list4.sort()
list4
Out[18]:
[1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Dictionaries
Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:

In [19]:
d = {'simple_key':'hello'}
# Grab 'hello'

d['simple_key']
Out[19]:
'hello'
In [20]:
d = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}
# Grab 'hello'

d['k1']['k2']
Out[20]:
'hello'
In [21]:
# Getting a little tricker
d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}
In [22]:
# This was harder than I expected...
d['k1'][0]['nest_key'][1][0]
Out[22]:
'hello'
In [23]:
# This will be hard and annoying!
d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}
In [24]:
# Phew!
d['k1'][2]['k2'][1]['tough'][2][0]
Out[24]:
'hello'
Can you sort a dictionary? Why or why not?

Answer: No! Because normal dictionaries are mappings not a sequence.

Tuples
What is the major difference between tuples and lists?

Tuples are immutable!

How do you create a tuple?

In [25]:
t = (1,2,3)
Sets
What is unique about a set?

Answer: They don't allow for duplicate items!

Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:

In [26]:
list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]
In [27]:
set(list5)
Out[27]:
{1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 22, 33}
Booleans
For the following quiz questions, we will get a preview of comparison operators. In the table below, a=3 and b=4.

Operator	Description	Example
==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.
>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.
What will be the resulting Boolean of the following pieces of code (answer fist then check by typing it in!)

In [28]:
# Answer before running cell
2 > 3
Out[28]:
False
In [29]:
# Answer before running cell
3 <= 2
Out[29]:
False
In [30]:
# Answer before running cell
3 == 2.0
Out[30]:
False
In [31]:
# Answer before running cell
3.0 == 3
Out[31]:
True
In [32]:
# Answer before running cell
4**0.5 != 2
Out[32]:
False
Final Question: What is the boolean output of the cell block below?

In [33]:
# two nested lists
l_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
l_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

# True or False?
l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']
Out[33]:
False
